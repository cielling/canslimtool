## This company seems to have "funny" XBRL document sometimes. 
## Sometimes, there is no Description- tag inside of a Document-tag, causing
## the SecFiling class to crash (this was fixed).
## I also found a bug in the SecFiling class where a valid xbrlInstance that was 
## found was later overwritten, just because under some circumstances it saved the
## the last one it found, not the first one.
